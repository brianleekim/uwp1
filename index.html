                <p class="highlighted-text">
                    This Multiple Genre Project (MGP) explores the impact of AI on job automation. 
                    I chose this topic because it is an increasingly relevant issue in the modern economy, affecting a wide range of industries and professions. 
                    Understanding AI's influence on the workforce is crucial for adapting and preparing for the future of work. 
                </p>
                <p class="highlighted-text">
                    The project uses two genres: an infographic and an interview. The infographic visually represents the data and trends related to AI and job automation, 
                    making complex information accessible and engaging for the audience. The interview with Heon Kim, a senior manager at Apple, provides expert insights and 
                    an in-depth look at the implications of AI in a professional setting, enhancing the overall narrative with firsthand industry perspective.
                </p>
                <p class="highlighted-text">
                    Through this project, I learned how AI is transforming industries and creating both challenges and opportunities in the job market. 
                    I hope the reader gains a deeper understanding of these changes and recognizes the importance of adapting skills and knowledge to stay relevant in an evolving economy.

                <p class="highlighted-text">
                    The aim is to present these perspectives in an organized, visually appealing format that guides the reader through the content seamlessly. 
                    By engaging with both the visual and text-based elements, readers can develop a more comprehensive view of AIâ€™s role in job automation.
