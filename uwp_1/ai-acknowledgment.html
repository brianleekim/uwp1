                <h2>AI Acknowledgement Statement</h2>
                <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to assist in determining the structure and format of my Multigenre Project. Specifically, I used ChatGPT to suggest how to package my project as a website or blog. These suggestions helped inform the organization of my reflective essay, infographic, and overall content presentation.</p>
                <p><strong>Description of use of AI:</strong> Prompts used with ChatGPT were focused on guiding the structure and layout of the project as a website or blog. The AI provided ideas for integrating multimodal elements and organizing them in an interactive, user-friendly format. Where information from ChatGPT was used directly, I have ensured that its influence is clearly acknowledged in my project.</p>
                <p><strong>Prompt 1:</strong> "how can i organize my multigenre project with a reflective essay and infographic as a website or blog?"</p>
                <p><strong>Output 1:</strong> ChatGPT suggested structuring the project with a homepage that includes the introduction and links to separate pages for the reflective essay and infographic. It also recommended platforms such as Google Sites, WordPress, or Wix for creating the blog.</p>
                <p><strong>Prompt 2:</strong> "what is the best way to present a reflective essay and infographic on a website?"</p>
                <p><strong>Output 2:</strong> ChatGPT advised displaying the reflective essay as a blog post and embedding the infographic on a separate, visually engaging page, with options for interactive elements.</p>
